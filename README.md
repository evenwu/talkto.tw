# [Talk to Taiwan](http://talkto.tw/)

Have you ever wondered whether Taiwan media
can still offer robust news reports and ideas for thoughts?

Or are we left with only famous models,
"fresh meat" and specialty restaurants?

Besides endless screenshots of driving records and surveillance monitors...
The media should really be doing a much better job.

If we really care about the country in which we live,
we should not allow the media to tyrannize our attention in such a way.

If we really care about Taiwan's future,
we should not forsake our public sphere.

More importantly, we should not allow this election
to become a power play between political parties.

Taiwan does not have another decade to squander.

We must seriously explore the key issues facing Taiwan: 
whether it is education, health care, or industry restructuring.

We must make a meaningful policy debate out of this election.

Powered by the new media, digital innovations and design,
collaborating with live on-line broadcasters,
with the assistance of g0v,
we introduce “Talk to Taiwan”: a next-generation political talk show.

“Talk to Taiwan” invites important leaders and commentators
to engage in brilliant conversations.

Using an innovative program and new languages,
we make policy discussions more lively and interesting.

“Talk to Taiwan” will collect public opinion via Pol.is,
combining data analysis with artificial intelligence,
to engender meaningful public participation.

Let’s cast aside grand-sounding squabbles
between celebrity talk-show hosts.

Let’s join together and think collectively:
In the upcoming decade, how shall Taiwan move forward?

Please be on time and tune in to this
completely new kind of political talk show:
Talk to Taiwan.
